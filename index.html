							<p>Nutrition, nourishment, or aliment, is the supply of materials - food - required by organisms and cells to stay alive. In science and human medicine, nutrition is the science or practice of consuming and utilizing foods.</p>

							<h1 class="category-title">Why work with a Nutritionist?</h1>
							<p>Nutrition is far more involved than calories in versus calories out. I often see clients who aren't getting results because they aren't eating enough, or the timing and/or balance of their meals isn't in line with their body's optimal needs. Others are eating healthfully, but are unknowingly taking in more than they need to get to and stay at a healthy weight. After assessing your eating routine, an experienced nutritionist or dietitian will probably know right away what's holding you back from reaching your goals, and can guide you in the right direction. In terms of a strategy, I talk with my clients to determine what's best. Some want a structured plan, complete with personalized meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists. Others do better with simple, concrete goals to work on, such as making specific changes to their usual meals, or modifying their meal timing. Be clear about what feels right for you: if you don't respond well to structure, a structured eating plan isn't going to work.</p>

							<h1 class="category-title">What is Holistic Nutrition?</h1>
                            <p>Holistic Nutrition is an approach to Nutrition counseling that takes a deeper look into the root cause of a physiological issue someone is experiencing. Instead of simply treating the symptoms that are being experienced we look to reestablish balance at the root of where it has been lost in the body. Holistic nutrition looks closely at food intake but that is not where it ends. We also look at movement, digestion, hydration, social connections, stress levels and sleep. It focuses on the interconnected physiological, cultural, and mental roles of food in our lives.  All recommendations are backed by evidenced based science and will be made based on an in-depth analysis of the health history, thorough biochemical assessment and medical science.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>An important aspect of Holistic Nutrition is bio-individuality. I believe that your food and lifestyle needs are not the same as your neighbor. What may promote optimal health for one person may leave another person feeling unsatisfied. I support my client’s individual food needs and don’t impose a one-size fits all approach.</p>

							<p>The First Thing We Need To Do Is Crack The Code To Your Body + Its Unique Optimal Function.

                                    Your body is more than a meal plan.
                                    
                                    Your body is more than the lab results that came back from your doctor + say everything is “normal”, even though you know something is still isn’t right.
                                    
                                    Your body is a complex living creation equipped with a human heart filled with emotions and a chameleon pulse – calmly steady or elevated with joy depending on your environment.</p>
